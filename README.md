# BurgerTime

This game was made with my own 2D engine.

The engine uses a component bases system.
It uses states for the playes and enemies.
To track the lives and the points of the players, the observer patern is used.

The engine uses SDL_mixer2 for sounds. The sound is accessible using a service locator.

Players and enemies have animated textures.

The engine has support for keyboard and controlles
